	bool "Root FS rotation initramfs"

	help
	  Build an initramfs managing root FS rotation. This initramfs
	  will create an overlay FS based on a /rootfs.squashfs as lower
	  directory, /upper as upper directory and /work as work directory.
	  This overlay FS will be the visible root FS for the system.

	  You can specify the name of a new root FS in the kernel command
	  line using new_root=new.rootfs. If a file with this name exists
	  in the root of the real root filesystem, a rotation is done
	  before overlay FS creation, i.e. the /rootfs.squashfs is deleted
	  and replaced with /new.rootfs.
